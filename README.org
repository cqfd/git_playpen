Sample repo to play around with while learning git. Clone it, fork it,
mess around! Just reclone if you mess something up.

Tip: I suggest you `brew install tree`; this gives you a command-line
tool for pretty-printing a directory. This is helpful if you want to
pretty-print the inside of your repo's .git/ directory.
